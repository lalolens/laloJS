## File Descriptions

### **src/**
- **Chat.tsx**: The main component file that implements the chat interface. It provides customizable props like `initialMessages`, `title`, `placeholderText`, and `themeColor`. This file is written in TypeScript and uses React to provide a user-friendly, interactive chat component.
- **index.ts**: The entry point that exports the `Chat` component. This file ensures the `Chat` component is available for use when importing the package.
- **Chat.css**: The CSS file for styling the chat component. It includes the layout, typography, and overall look-and-feel of the chat interface.

### **dist/**
- This folder contains the compiled output files generated during the build process. These files are ignored in version control and are used when consuming the package in other projects.

### **Makefile**
- Automates the different tasks involved in developing, building, and publishing the package. Key commands include:
  - **all**: Installs dependencies and builds the project.
  - **install**: Installs all necessary dependencies.
  - **build**: Compiles TypeScript files and bundles them using Rollup.
  - **start**: Runs a development server to test the component locally.
  - **run-local**: Runs the TypeScript files directly without building.
  - **publish**: Publishes the package to npm.
  - **install-package**: Installs the package from the GitHub repository.

### **package.json**
- Defines the metadata for the package, including its name, version, description, scripts, dependencies, and more. Key points:
  - **name**: `@lalolens/chat` - The name of the package.
  - **scripts**: Commands for development (`dev`), building (`build`), and serving (`serve`) the package.
  - **dependencies** and **devDependencies**: Lists the required dependencies for production and development.

### **rollup.config.js**
- Configuration file for Rollup, which is used to bundle the TypeScript files into a single module. It outputs an ES6 module and includes plugins for handling TypeScript and CSS.

### **tsconfig.json**
- TypeScript configuration file that defines compiler options, such as targeting ES6, enabling JSX, and outputting declaration files. It helps ensure consistent TypeScript builds.

### **.gitignore**
- Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control. This includes `node_modules/` and `dist/` to prevent unnecessary files from being committed.

### **README.md**
- Documentation for the `@lalolens/chat` package. It describes the functionality, usage, and instructions for building and running the project.

### **sitemap**
- A placeholder file intended for navigation or project overview. Not directly used by the chat package.

## Running and Testing the Package Locally

This package can be run and tested locally. The following steps explain how to get started:

1. **Install Dependencies**
   
   Navigate to the `chat` directory and run:
   
   ```sh
   make install
   ```

2. **Build the Project**
   
   To build the project, run:
   
   ```sh
   make build
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**
   
   To test the chat component in a browser, you can run:
   
   ```sh
   make start
   ```
   
   This will start a development server, allowing you to see the component in action.

4. **Run the Project Locally**
   
   If you want to execute the TypeScript code directly without building it, use:
   
   ```sh
   make run-local
   ```

## Using the Package in Other Projects

To use the `@lalolens/chat` package in another project, you can either install it from npm (after publishing) or directly from the GitHub repository.
